  In this afternoon,Larry bring us a fantastic game which call [marshmallow challenge](http://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html).

  Simply put,each team have 18 minutes to use limit material to build a staff as high as possible.The material is simple which include dry spaghetti and one yard of tape and a marshmallow.The result is unsatisfied to us but expected by the lecture.The final height of our tower is ZERO.

  We make many mistakes.Firstly,we didn't notice how fast the time is elapse.Meanwhile we don't define very clear time period.if we have one more chance,we could brain storm to provide idea in first three minutes.Then in 5-15 minutes,making our prototype.if the prototype is relatively available, we could try more aggressive solution.If so, we could get a relative satisfying work at last.

  In fact,if you watch the TED talk show,you will learn more.For instance,the majority of team neglect the risk of the marshmallow until the last minutes.The wiser approach is stick the marshmallow at first,then iteratively construct the spaghetti tower.
