###This week:Second week of working in Ericsson.

Before I join Ericsson,I never thought that I would choosed a communication enterprise to begin my career.After all, my origin aiming is to be a Front-End developer in certain ".com" company. Now I realize how naive I am.

>I used to thought that Ericsson just a communication hardware company,however,Ericsson also is the fifth largest software company.

>I used to consider that Ericsson's developement process is Waterfall.However, I witnessed how agile been executed in such big-size enterprise.

>I mistook that Ericsson are not fit for youth who should chase money rather than choosing a life of ease.However,I understand how important it to balance the life and work is.
