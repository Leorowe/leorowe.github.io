This week:Second week of working in Ericsson.

Before I join Ericsson,I never thought that I would choosed a communication enterprise to begin my career.After all, my origin aiming is to be a Front-End developer in certain ".com" company. Now I realize how naive I am.

>I used to thought that Ericsson just a communication hardware company,however,Ericsson also is the fifth largest software company.

>I used to consider that Ericsson's developement process is Waterfall.However, I witnessed how agile been executed in such big-size enterprise.

>I mistook that Ericsson are not fit for youth who should chase money rather than choosing a life of ease.However,I understand how important it to balance the life and work is.

The keyword of this week is  **CI**, **Maven**, **Specification by Example** ,**Refactor and Testing**. Let me declare these word one by one.
 
CI, which is the abbreviation of Continuous Integration. I first touched CI is in the book--[Continuous Delivery](http://book.douban.com/subject/6862062/ "Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deploy")
When I was in my previous Start-up company, I was highly interested in applying this tech and to improve CM process. However, because of lack of time and opportunity to study, we didn’t adopt it.
 
Maven.  Before meeting with Maven, I am busy searching Google to find certain jar or dependency. This process is  so painful. One day ,I found that the demo of certain framework only have a pom.xml in the directory rather than containing dependency jar. I was curious about how to build such project , then I learn Maven after searching Google. After this course, I know how to configure the private Repository to Nexus. This tip is new to me.
 
Specification by Example(SbE). In school, book only told us how to use specification document or user case to record specification. After learning this course, I realized  the advantage about the SbE method. After all human language is relatively ambiguous, example could be used to fade out this barrier.
 
Refactor. Similar to CI,I firstly knew the Refactor because of this book-[Refactoring](http://book.douban.com/subject/1419359/ "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"). However, lack of patient, I haven’t read the book until now. Thanks for WeiYe giving us a quick demo about how to refactor “bad smell” code. Now ,I have relatively  shallow understanding about Refactor.
 
Testing. Johan gave us a brief introduction about the principle of the testing and testing methodology. His little Swedish accent English let me recalled my time that  I was an Exchange Student in Finland J .
Although there is no much new knowledge to me, it indeed help me review the testing theory that I was  told by my school teacher.
